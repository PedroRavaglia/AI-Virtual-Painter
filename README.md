# About The Project

I've used [mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) libraries to track our hand position in real-time and draw on the screen using the index finger.

Other features implemented:

* You can select the thickness of the draw using the distance between the thumb and the index finger, selecting the desired size when the pinky finger is up.
<div style="width:360px;max-width:100%;"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:56.39%;position:relative;"><iframe width="360" height="203" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameBorder="0" src="https://imgflip.com/embed/5cpftx"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/5cpftx">via Imgflip</a></p></div>

* Using the index and the middle finger you enter in the Selection Mode, and you can select the different colors and the eraser at the top of the screen.

* You can enter in the stand by mode using only the index and the pinky finger (indicated by a line between these 2 fingers). This mode is useful when you want to draw separate things on the screen.

* After Drawing on the screen you can clean it just by closing your hand.
